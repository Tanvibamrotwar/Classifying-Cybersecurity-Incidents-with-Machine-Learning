# Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning
# Problem satement:
Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents utilizing the comprehensive GUIDE dataset.Project goal is to create a classification model that categorizes incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) based on historical evidence and customer responses. The model should be robust enough to support guided response systems in providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, ultimately improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

## Approach:
1. **Data Exploration and Understanding:**
   + Initial Inspection: we Start by loading the train.csv dataset and perform an initial inspection to understand the structure of the data, including the number of 
     features, types of variables (categorical, numerical), and the distribution of the target variable (TP, BP, FP).
   + Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and potential anomalies in the data. Given special 
     attention to class imbalances by handling them with SMOTE technique.
2.	**Data Preprocessing:**
    + Handling Missing Data: Identified any missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy, such as imputation, removing affected rows, or using models 
      that can handle missing data inherently.
    +	Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modified existing ones to improve model performance. For example, combining related features, deriving new features from 
      timestamps (like hour of the day or day of the week), or normalizing numerical variables.
    +	Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target 
      encoding, depending on the nature of the feature and its relationship with the target variable.
3.	**Data Splitting:**
    + Train-Validation Split: spliting the train.csv data into training and validation sets. This allow us tuning and evaluating the model before final testing on test.csv. a 
      80-20 split is used, but this can vary depending on the dataset's size.
    +	Stratification: the target variable is imbalanced, so we used stratified sampling to ensure that both the training and validation sets have similar class distributions.
4.	**Model Selection and Training:**
    +	Baseline Model: Starting with a simple baseline model, such as a logistic regression or decision tree, to establish a performance benchmark. 
    +	Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines ( XGBoost), and Neural Networks. Each model is tuned using 
      techniques like grid search or random search over hyperparameters.
    +	Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data. This 
      reduces the risk of overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
5.	**Model Evaluation and Tuning:**
    + Performance Metrics:we Evaluate the model using the validation set, focusing on macro-F1 score, precision, and recall. Analyzed these metrics across different classes 
      (TP, BP, FP) to ensure balanced performance.
    +	Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on the initial evaluation, fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance. 
    +	Handling Class Imbalance: class imbalance is a significant issue, applied SMOTE technique to balance the data.
6.	**Model Interpretation:**
    +	Feature Importance: After selecting the best model, analyzed feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions. This is done by random 
      forest model.
    +	Error Analysis: Performed an error analysis to identify common misclassifications. This provide insights into potential improvements, such as additional feature 
      engineering or refining the model's complexity.
7.	**Final Evaluation on Test Set:**
    + Testing: Once the model is finalized and optimized,we  evaluate it on the test.csv dataset. Reporting the final macro-F1 score, precision, and recall to assess how well 
      the model generalizes to unseen data.
    +	Comparison to Baseline: Compared the performance on the test set to the baseline model and initial validation results to ensure consistency and improvement.
8. **Reporting:**
    + Model Documentation: Rationale for model choices, challenges, and optimizations.
    + Recommendations:
        Integration into SOC Workflows: Automate triage and prioritization.
        Continuous Improvement: Regular updates with new data.
        Feature Engineering and Refinement: Enhance model performance with additional features.
        Handling Class Imbalance: Explore advanced techniques like cost-sensitive learning.
        Real-World Deployment: Consider computational requirements and real-time data processing.

## Business Use Cases:
The solution  that we developed in this project can be implemented in various business scenarios, particularly in the field of cybersecurity. Some potential applications include:
*	Security Operation Centers (SOCs): Automating the triage process by accurately classifying cybersecurity incidents, thereby allowing SOC analysts to prioritize their efforts and respond to critical threats more efficiently.
*	Incident Response Automation: Enabling guided response systems to automatically suggest appropriate actions for different types of incidents, leading to quicker mitigation of 
 potential threats.
*	Threat Intelligence: Enhancing threat detection capabilities by incorporating historical evidence and customer responses into the triage process, which can lead to more accurate identification of true and false positives.
*	Enterprise Security Management: Improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments by reducing the number of false positives and ensuring that true threats are addressed promptly.
